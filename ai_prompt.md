Create a component called 'NSelect' continue the name naming conventions followed by other components in
this project. NButton.css NButton.spec.ts NButton.stories.js NButton.vue to provide an example.
Always use the options api and keep the same styles in the library. Don't forget to add the new
componet to index.ts.

I just want this to be a basic select but using the same styles as my other input components in this library.
